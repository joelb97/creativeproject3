    <h3>How will lockdowns affect my order?</h3>
    <p>At the moment, Cargo is continuing to operate around the globe to get much-needed supplies to countries. Our product is considered a vital product, and therefore we should not have issues shipping your masks.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>I am working in a hospital/clinic, is this mask suitable for me?</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately, the Battaglia Mask is not suitable to be used in a hospital setting by members of a healthcare team as it is not a single-use item and hence you would not want to dispose of it after contact with an infected patient. The hospital you work at will have an infection control policy which should be used when dealing with infected patients.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Does the Battaglia Mask filter Coronavirus?</h3>
    <p>Our masks are tested to filter 99.6% of viruses and bacteria. Viruses usually travel on droplets of water, which are very large. The mask will block these particles.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>How to properly wash the Battaglia Mask?</h3>
    <p>Thorough washing will remove viruses and bacterial from all surfaces including hands, masks and worktops etc. Battaglia Masks are hand washable, and should then be hung dry. Do not machine wash or machine dry as this can damage the mask.</p>
